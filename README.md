### Hi there 👋. My name is Nicolay Bang. I am an aspiring full stack developper.
“If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.”

"(...) and again and again and again until it works" -Nicolay Bang

During the lockdown I taught myself coding and found that I had a passion for code and computer sciences in general. This pushed me to complete a certificate in IT & Computers at McGill University. I have been living and breathing code since then. I am very eager to expand my knowledge and my skills either professionally, through personal projects or even through open source projects. 



- 🔭 I’m currently working on a full stack recipe book web service. Still in development, online for testing at: <a href="http://titepoule.herokuapp.com/"> titepoule.herokuapp.com </a><br><br>
