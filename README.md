### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Nicolay Bang. I am an aspiring full stack developper. During the lockdown I thought myself coding and found that I had a passion for code and computer sciences in general. This pushed me to complete a certificate in IT & Computers at Mcgill University. I have been living and breathing code since then. I am very eager to expand my knowledge and my skills either professionnaly, through personnal projects or even through open source projects.
